# FreeCol Mod
This is a [FreeCol](http://www.freecol.org/) Mod. FreeCol is a turn-based strategy game based on the old game Colonization, and similar to Civilization. The objective of the game is to create an independent nation. You start with only a few colonists defying the stormy seas in their search for new land.

# Expanded Experience
This mod allows free colonists to gain experience from working in buildings. By default, FreeCol only allows experience to be gained by doing outside work to become an expert. This mod allows the free colonist to become an expert/master after a time of working in a particular building including: City Hall (Elder Statesmen), Lumber Mill (Master Carpenter), Master Tobacconist, Master Weaver, Master Distiller, Master Fur Trader, Master Blacksmith, Master Gunsmith, and become a Firebrand Preacher through producing crosses in the Church or Cathedral. The chance to become a master within any building increases from 0% until the free colonist has produced 200 units and increases the chance to become a master by 3% per turn. By contrast, free colonists working outside have up to a 4% chance of becoming an expert.
